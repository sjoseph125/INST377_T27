              <h1>Our project idea focuses transparency in politics, specifically regarding legislative funding.</h1>
               <p>Many people are unaware of the various political intricacies present with the United States Government.
                 <br>Using an API offered by The Center for Responsive Politics, we gathered some important financial data about the representatives and senators of each state.
                 <br>While our adaptation of the API does not cover an extensive field of political and financial data, it does cover the following things which the average person may find useful:
               </p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Top general contributors for a given representative/senator</li>
                 <li>Top industries that support a given representative/senator</li>
                 <li>Summary data for a representative/senator that includes total funding data among other statistics</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>While our project is unlikely to provide any groundbreaking insight into a politician's financial activity,
                  <br>we do hope that people can use the information we've condensed as a point of reference when thinking about who they want to support.
                  <br>A condensed map of the United States which displays data upon click is presented, and will display the data mentioned earlier.
