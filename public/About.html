              <h1>Our project idea focuses transparency in politics, specifically regarding legislative funding.</h1>
              <p>Many people are unaware of the various political intricacies present with the United States Government.
              Using an API offered by The Center for Responsive Politics, we gathered some important financial data about the representatives and senators of each state.
              While our adaptation of the API does not cover an extensive field of political and financial data, it does cover the following things which the average person may find useful:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Top general contributors for a given representative/senator</li>
                <li>Top industries that support a given representative/senator</li>
                <li>Summary data for a representative/senator that includes total funding data among other statistics</li>
              </ul>
              <p>While our project is unlikely to provide any groundbreaking insight into a politician's financial activity,
              we do hope that people can use the information we've condensed as a point of reference when thinking about who they want to support.
              A condensed map of the United States which displays data upon click is presented, and will display the data mentioned earlier.
